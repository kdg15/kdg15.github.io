    <h1>Scoresheet</h1>

    <p>A simple app for keeping score while you play your favourite game. Open Scoresheet instead of grabbing a pencil and sheet of paper. Create a new scoresheet by entering player names. After a round of play enter the score for each player. Scoresheet will sum the score totals for you.</p>
